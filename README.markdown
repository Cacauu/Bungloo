Tentia
=======

Tentia is a slim Tent client for OS X written in mostly JavaScript.
It doesn't implement much of Tents functionality, only the things **I**
care for. Therefore it is **small** and **fast** and looks good
by doing so. _"Keep it simple, stupid!"_ Is the mantra, therefore there
will not by much more functionality as it is now. But you're welcome to
fork and extend it.

[Download Tentia](http://github.com/downloads/jeena/Tentia/Ttentia.app.zip)

It works on Mac OS 10.5 and higher.
