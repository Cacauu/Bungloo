= Twittia

Twittia is a slim Twitter client for OS X written in mostly JavaScript.
It doesn't implement much of Twitters functionality, only the things *I*
care for. Therefore it is _small_ (84 KB) and _fast_.
_Keep it simple, stupid!_ Is the mantra, therefore there will not by much more
functionality as it is now. But you're welcome to fork and extend it.
